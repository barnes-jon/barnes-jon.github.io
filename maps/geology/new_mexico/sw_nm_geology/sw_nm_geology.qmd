  <abstract>Geologic Map of New Mexico. This feature class represents geologic units, water, or anthropogenic deposits (built from ContactsAndFaults and MapUnitLines) that occupy mappable areas. Detailed information about each mapped unit is provided via a join based on the MapUnit field to the DescriptionOfMapUnits table.
COMMENTS TO MAP USERS
A geologic map displays information on the distribution, nature, orientation, and age relationships of rock and deposits and the occurrence of structural features. Geologic and fault contacts are irregular surfaces that form boundaries between different types or ages of units. Data depicted on this geologic quadrangle map may be based on any of the following: reconnaissance field geologic mapping, a compilation of published and unpublished work, and photogeologic interpretation. Locations of contacts are not surveyed but are plotted by interpretation of the position of a given contact onto a topographic base map; therefore, the accuracy of contact locations depends on the scale of mapping and the interpretation of the geologist(s). Any enlargement of this map could cause misunderstanding in the detail of mapping and may result in erroneous interpretations. Site-specific conditions should be verified by detailed surface mapping or subsurface exploration. Topographic and cultural changes may not be shown due to recent development. Cross sections are constructed based upon the interpretations of the author made from geologic mapping and available geophysical and subsurface (drill hole) data.
Cross sections should be used as an aid to understanding the general geologic framework of the map area and not be the sole source of information for use in locating or designing wells, buildings, roads, or other human-made structures.
The New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources created the Open-File Geologic Map Series to expedite the dissemination of these geologic maps and map data to the public as rapidly as possible while allowing for map revision as geologists continued to work in map areas. Each map sheet carries the original date of publication below the map and the latest revision date in the upper right corner. In most cases, the original publication date coincides with the date of delivery of the map product to the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program (NCGMP) as part of New Mexicoâ€™s STATEMAP agreement. While maps are produced, maintained, and updated in an ArcGIS geodatabase, at the time of the STATEMAP deliverable, each map goes through cartographic production and internal review before uploading to the Internet. Even if additional updates are carried out on the ArcGIS map data files, citations to these maps should reflect this original publication date and the original authors listed. The views and conclusions contained in these map documents are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the State of New Mexico or the U.S. Government.

This feature class represents areas of distinct lithologic units on a geologic map produced by the New Mexico Bureau of Geology &amp; Mineral Resources. The geodatabase data model conforms to the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Geologic Map Schema (GeMS) data model.</abstract>
